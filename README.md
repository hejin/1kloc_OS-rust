# 1kloc_OS-rust

It's a trial of so called "vibe coding" to learn rust-lang quickly as a system developer.

The overall flow is to use chatgpt (free plan) for Clang -> Rust code translation, and deepseek for rust code explaination, plus the fix proposals from rust building error msgs - comparing to the error msgs from c++ compilers, it's far more friendly!!!

Thanks to Seiya Nuta for his splendid work [OS in 1,000 Lines](https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en/07-kernel-panic).
